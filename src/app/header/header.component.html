    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        Coding has been a passion of mine since my time as a Web Integrator, where I first discovered the thrill of creating something from scratch. For me, programming is more than just writing code; it is the journey from feeling like the least knowledgeable person in the room to mastering a challenge and delivering a solution. That rollercoaster of learning and problem-solving is what keeps me motivated and gives me an incredible dopamine hit when everything clicks into place.
        <br>
        In my free time, I have recently shifted from World of Warcraft to more relaxed yet equally complex games like Factorio. The game’s focus on building and optimizing production systems mirrors the very principles I use in coding—planning, problem-solving, and optimizing systems to ensure they function as efficiently as possible. I find the challenge of creating streamlined, efficient systems in Factorio to be a rewarding parallel to my work as a developer.

        When I’m not coding or gaming, I love to climb and have really gotten into the sport. Staying active and social is important to me, and back in Odense, I enjoyed playing badminton as a fun way to connect with others and stay healthy. After a busy week, there is nothing better than relaxing with a cold beer and good company.

        Although I would not describe myself as particularly creative, I often come up with some pretty wild ideas. When I do not have something urgent on my plate, I tend to dive headfirst into these ideas and get completely absorbed until I have figured it out. I have a strong ability to hyper-focus, and once I am in the zone, I do not stop until the task is done.
